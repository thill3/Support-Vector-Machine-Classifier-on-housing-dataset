# Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier-on-housing-dataset

This code relies on the housing preprocessing code that has its own repository.
Summary below.
1) Set up a grid search for the Support Vector Regressor.
2) Use 5-fold cross validationto determine the best parameters from the options presented in (1).
3) Because the best value for one of the parameters is at the maximum of the range I set up then I'll try higher values.
4) The best value is still at the maximum of the range, so I try higher values.
